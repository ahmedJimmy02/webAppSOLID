    new ObjectId('657a0342c1c4f8d55d226786') => product.userId
                  657a0342c1c4f8d55d226786 => owner from query because anything in the query are string 
    and in this case i get product.userId and his type is ObjectId
    and the type of owner i was sent this in params was string 
    if(product.userId !== owner){
        return 'You are not authorized' //apply
    } 
    because they are different types
