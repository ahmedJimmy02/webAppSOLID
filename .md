    new ObjectId('657a0342c1c4f8d55d226786') => product.userId
                  657a0342c1c4f8d55d226786 => owner from query because anything in the query are string 
    and in this case i get product.userId and his type is ObjectId
    and the type of owner i was sent in params was string 
    if(product.userId !== owner){
        return 'You are not authorized' //apply
    } 
    because they are different types

        are properties that are not persisted to the database but can be used in application
        apply in onw document findById()

    not a logic of code but it is a concept

    any thing that return large sets of objects called (cursor) that fetches documents in batches 
    to reduce both memory consumption and network bandwidth usage
    examples: find()

validation concept(joi)
    validation core function && schema
validation middleware => data send in many places EX=> body, query,params,headers
make array of requestKeys = ['body' , 'params' , 'query' , 'headers']
for loop on requestKeys

validationResult.error.details => return array for this reson we are user (...) to make validationErrorArr
one dimensional array
